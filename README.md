# 3. LoGS Pipeline
Here is how LoGS re-localizes the scenes we experimented in our paper, e.g. 7-scenes (dslam ground truth and full training images). You need to run four python files one by one.

1. pre-process the 7-scenes dataset.
```
python gs_localization/process/train_test_split_7scenes_full_dslam.py
``` 

2. obtain a SfM point could of training images and rough initial poses of testing images through PnP-RANSAC.
```
python gs_localization/sfm/7scenes_sfm_full_dslam.py
``` 

3. train a 3DGS map of training images.
```
python gs_localization/gs/7scenes_gs_full_dslam.py
```

4. refines poses with gradient decent and we are done.
```
python gs_localization/pipelines/7scenes_localize_full_dslam.py
```
